# Testing the Animals


## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/python/exercises/testing && cd $_
touch animals.py
```
Copy the contents of animals.py into the file you just created.

## Overview

As a team, we'll be building unit test coverage for all the functionality of the code in the animal module. We'll discuss how writing tests often affect the implementation code, and how to think bout covering edge cases in your test suit.

### Instructions

Write test cases to verify the I/O of the following methods of ```Animal``` and ```Dog```.

1. In the test class' ```setUpClass()``` method, create an instance of ```Animal``` and ```Dog```.
2. Animal object has the correct name property.
3.Set a species and verify that the object property of species has the correct value.
4. Invoking the walk() method set the correct speed on the both objects.
5. The animal object is an instance of Animal.
6. The dog object is an instance of Dog.

## Test Discovery

Read the Test Discovery section of the Python docs. It explains how you can run all tests inside a directory. This allows you to split your unit test suite into many, smaller, more maintainable modules, and the use a pattern matcher to find tests in all matching files.

```python -m unittest discover -s . -p "Test*.py" -v```
